Future State
===================================


The final project for me is where the journey begins.  I have leveraged a very small portion of vast majority of
data available to fight through the Covid Pandemic.  I plan to leverage extensive amount of data available
via open source community and build further on my final project and explore.


Explore more data sources including CDC datasets, World Health organization hosted datasets and extend my work
beyond Covid.  Expand my work to include direct datasource and datasets consumption, aggregation and visualization.


While the final project focuses on Covid data, I have further interests to explore other diseases related
data available through various sources, build insightful solutions and contribute them all back to open
source community.
