Continuous Learning
===================================


I have continued to appreciate the amount of learning through the program journey and learnt to appreciate
advanced python not just as another programming language but the value it brings to data science community.


Along the way I have learnt to work with several advanced python packages and libraries and further
addicted to exploring.  Here are some of the highlights and contributions but not limited to:


- Working with large complex files, data analysis and simplifying them using Advanced Python libraries and functions

- Working extensively with Luigi, DASK and also working with new packages that I can develop for reuse

- Working with scikit-learn, seaborn and datashader libraries, expand on both models execution and visualization

- Working with Django REST framework and establishing variety of integration patterns

- Integrating and working simple machine learning models and opportunities to further expand

- Integrating with popular frameworks including Angular, ChartJS and such

- Provide the solution for open source community use and continue to contribute
