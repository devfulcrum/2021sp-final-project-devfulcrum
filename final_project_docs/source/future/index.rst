Future State
===================================


The final project for me is where the journey begins.  I have leveraged a very small portion of vast majority of
data available to fight through the Covid Pandemic.  I plan to leverage extensive amount of data available
via open source community and build further on my final project and explore.


While the final project focuses on Covid data, I have further interests to explore other diseases related
data available through various sources, build insightful solutions and contribute them all back to open
source community.
